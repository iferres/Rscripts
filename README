# R-scripts for some easy analyses

## parseBlastResult.R
This script takes a blast output file, a qcov and a pid thresholds, and returns in stout the hits which pass the filters.
I don't remember how was the format of the blast output supposed to be, update on this soon :)


## read_domtblout.R 
Read a hmmsearch domtblout output, and return to the second argument (a file) a parseable tab separated value file.
